# Understanding of Data:

Regarding understanding of data, I decided split the visualization in 4 parts which are "Overview", "Products", "Purchases" and "Campaigns" with respect to requirements.
Because, all of them are equally important for the visualization purpose.

More Info:

* Overview: It contains information regarding the details of dashboard in summary form.
* Products: It contains information regarding different products, products with respect to countries, products with respect to customers and Insights from it.
* Purchases: It contains information regarding sum of different types of purchases, Top Countries by Purchases, Top Customers By Purchases and Key Infuencer Visual.
* Campaings: It contains information regarding % Offers accepted in different campaigns and Insights.

# Theme and Color Palette Used:

* I went with the dark theme here for this dashboard.
* Colors chosen: Blue, White, Black and Orange.

# Visualization and parameters:

For the viz. purpose, I used Figma to create a background of 720*1280px, used white color for navigation panes and filter.

# Conclusion:
Overall, it was a nice dataset to analyze and made me better and understanding of data and visualization.
